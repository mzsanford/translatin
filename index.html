    <p>This is some text that I would like to translate. The trick is, of course, that I don't want just one small
      thing translated but a long-form doc. To make matters worse it has real HTML markup within the text. Things like
      <strong>bold</strong> should be cake. But what about multiple paragraphs?</p>

    <p>Can you handle multiple &lt;p&gt; tags? It seems like you should be able to. Also, you need to make sure
      you segment sentences in some sane way. Even if they say things like a.k.a. or Dr. Jones. Those extra periods
      should be a walk in the park.</p>
